<span class="label">Title:</span>      Possible information disclosure in BMP decoder<br/>
<span class="label">Impact:</span>     Moderate<br/>
<span class="label">Announced:</span>  February 19, 2008<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Gynvael Coldwind // Vexillium<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox, SeaMonkey<br/>
<br/>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Firefox 2.0.0.12<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      SeaMonkey 1.1.8<br/>
</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Gynvael Coldwind</strong> of Vexillium
(crediting help from <strong>udevd</strong> and <strong>porneL</strong>)
demonstrated that BMP images
could be used to reveal small chunks of uninitialized memory
that might contain sensitive data from other pages or other
programs, and that this data could be extracted from the
image using methods associated with the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>
feature.
</p>
<p class="note">Because this flaw also affected products from other vendors disclosure
was delayed until they could release a fix.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Thunderbird was incorrectly listed as affected by this
vulnerability. The maliciously formed BMP images would contain
noise influenced by uninitialized memory as in Firefox, but Thunderbird
lacks the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> feature necessary for an attacker
to extract the data from the image.

</p><h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.</p>

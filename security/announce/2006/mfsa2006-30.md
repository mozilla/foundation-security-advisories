title: MFSA 2006-30: Deleted object reference when designMode="on"

<h1>Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-30</h1>

<p><span class="label">Title:</span>      Deleted object reference when designMode="on"<br/>
<span class="label">Impact:</span>     Critical<br/>
<span class="label">Date:</span>       May 2, 2006<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Martijn Wargers, Nick Mott, splices<br/>
<span class="label">Affects:</span>    Firefox 1.5<br/>
<br/>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Firefox 1.5.0.3</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Martijn Wargers and Nick Mott each described crashes that were discovered
to ultimately stem from the same root cause: attempting to use a deleted
controller context when designMode was turned on. This generally
results in crashing the browser, but in theory references to deleted objects
can be abused to run malicious code.</p>

<p>"splices" reported the same crash at the fan site MozillaZine
and on Bugtraq, incorrectly describing it as a buffer overflow.</p>

<p><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Update (31 July 2006)</b></p>

<p>The advisory originally stated that older clients (Firefox 1.0.x and the Mozilla
Suite 1.7.x) were unaffected. This is incorrect as demonstrated by the testcase
MoBB#4 at the Browser Fun Blog. Those clients were already at risk from
many other published vulnerabilities and should no longer be used.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Temporarily disable JavaScript until you can upgrade to a fixed version.</p>

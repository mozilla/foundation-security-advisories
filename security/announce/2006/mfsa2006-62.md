title: MFSA 2006-62: Popup-blocker cross-site scripting (XSS)

<h1>Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-62</h1>

<p><span class="label">Title:</span>      Popup-blocker cross-site scripting (XSS)<br/>
<span class="label">Impact:</span>     Moderate<br/>
<span class="label">Announced:</span>  September 14, 2006<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   shutdown<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox<br/>
<br/>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Firefox 1.5.0.7</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>shutdown demonstrated that blocked popups opened from the status bar
"blocked popups" icon were always opened in the context of the site
listed in the Location (address) bar, even if the blocked popup were
originally opened by a subframe loaded from another site. This allows
the popup to perform a cross-site scripting attack against the framing
web site.</p>

<p>This does not appear to be much of a practical threat. The malicious
page would first have to get itself framed by the target page, attempt
to open a popup, and then convince the user that the popup contents
were so important or interesting that it must be opened manually. (Before
<a href="mfsa2006-61.html">MFSA&#160;2006-61</a> was fixed the first step
was simpler: find a target site that uses frames and open it in a
popup -- which might itself be blocked.)</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Avoid opening blocked popups from the blocked-popup icon in the status
bar. Instead if you wish to see popups add the site to the popup-blocking
whitelist and reload to get the popup with the correct context.</p>

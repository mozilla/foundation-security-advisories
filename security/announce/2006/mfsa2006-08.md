<h1>Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-08</h1>

<p><span class="label">Title:</span>      "AnyName" entrainment and access control hazard<br/>
<span class="label">Severity:</span>   Low<br/>
<span class="label">Date:</span>       February 1, 2006<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Brendan Eich<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey<br/>
<br/>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Firefox 1.5.0.1<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      SeaMonkey 1.0<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      Thunderbird 1.5.0.2</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The implementation of E4X introduced an internal "AnyName" object which
was unintentionally exposed to web content. This singleton object could
be used by two cooperating domains as a communication channel to get
around same-origin restrictions that prevent direct access from one
window or frame to another. This could not be used to violate
same-origin protection of another window's content, it was simply a
mutually accessible storage spot. E4X was not supported in Firefox 1.0
or Mozilla 1.7</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird 1.5 could be vulnerable if JavaScript is
enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly
discourage users from turning on JavaScript in mail. Thunderbird
is not vulnerable in its default configuration.</p>

<p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Update (13 April 2006)</strong><br/>
This flaw has been fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.2</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Upgrade to the fixed versions. Do not enable JavaScript in Thunderbird
or SeaMonkey mail.</p>

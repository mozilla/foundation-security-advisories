<h1>Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-44</h1>

<p><span class="label">Title:</span>      Code execution through deleted frame reference<br/>
<span class="label">Impact:</span>     Critical<br/>
<span class="label">Announced:</span>  July 25, 2006<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Thilo Girmann<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox 1.5, SeaMonkey 1.0<br/>
<br/>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Firefox 1.5.0.5<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      SeaMonkey 1.0.3</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Thilo Girmann discovered that in certain circumstances a JavaScript
reference to a frame or window was not properly cleared when the
referenced content went away, and he demonstrated that this pointer
to a deleted object could be used to execute native code supplied
by the attacker.</p>

<p>This vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development, it does
not affect Firefox 1.0 or Mozilla Suite 1.7</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
JavaScript in mail.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until you can upgrade to a fixed version. Do not enable
JavaScript in mail clients such as Thunderbird.</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>Exploit details withheld until after the active update period.</p>

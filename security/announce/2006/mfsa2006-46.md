<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Secunia Research<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox, SeaMonkey<br/>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 1.5
branch, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
user's system.</p>

<p>The vulnerability is caused due to an memory corruption error within
the handling of simultaneously happening XPCOM events, which leads to
use of a deleted timer object. This generally results in a crash but
potentially could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a user's
system when a malicious website is visited.</p>

<p>This vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development, it does
not affect Firefox 1.0 or Mozilla Suite 1.7</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
JavaScript in mail.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until you can upgrade to a fixed version. Do not enable
JavaScript in mail clients such as Thunderbird.</p>

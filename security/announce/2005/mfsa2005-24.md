title: MFSA 2005-24: HTTP auth prompt tab spoofing

<h1>Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-24</h1>

<p><span class="label">Title:</span>      HTTP auth prompt tab spoofing<br/>
<span class="label">Severity:</span>   Low<br/>
<span class="label">Risk:</span>       Low<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Christian Schmidt<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox, Mozilla Suite<br/>
<br/>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Firefox 1.0.1<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      Mozilla Suite 1.7.6</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The HTTP authentication prompt appears above the currently open tab
regardless of which tab triggered it. A spoofer who could get a user
to open a high value target in another tab might be able to capture the
user's ID and password. HTTP auth dialogs are visually distinct from the
web form logins used by most commercial sites, and the HTTP auth dialog
clearly states which host it's for. Exploitation of this seems unlikely.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Do not browse trusted and untrusted sites in the same session. When
presented with a site login dialog double-check that it is for the
site you think it's for.</p>

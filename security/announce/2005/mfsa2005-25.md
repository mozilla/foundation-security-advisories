title: MFSA 2005-25: Image drag and drop executable spoofing

<h1>Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-25</h1>

<p><span class="label">Title:</span>      Image drag and drop executable spoofing<br/>
<span class="label">Severity:</span>   Critical<br/>
<span class="label">Risk:</span>       Moderate<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Michael Krax<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox, Thunderbird, Mozilla Suite<br/>
<br/>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Firefox 1.0.1<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      Thunderbird 1.0.2<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      Mozilla Suite 1.7.6</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Images dragged and dropped from a webpage to the desktop preserved
their original name and extension. If this were an executable extension
then the file would be executed rather than opened in a media application.</p>

<p>In order to exploit this the attacker would have to construct a valid
image that was also a valid executable. On windows this can be done
using a GIF image concatenated with a batch file. The attacker must
convince the user to drag the image to their desktop and sometime later
double click on it without noticing it has an executable icon rather than
the expected media type image.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Do not hide windows extensions. Be cautious downloading files from untrusted
sites.</p>

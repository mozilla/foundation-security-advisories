<span class="label">Title:</span>      Re-use of freed object due to scope confusion<br/>
<span class="label">Impact:</span>     Critical<br/>
<span class="label">Announced:</span>  April 1, 2010<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Nils (MWR InfoSecurity)<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox<br/>
<br/>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Firefox 3.6.3<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      Firefox 3.5.10<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      SeaMonkey 2.0.5<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      Thunderbird 3.0.5<br/>
</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A memory corruption flaw leading to code execution was reported by
security researcher <strong>Nils</strong> of MWR InfoSecurity during the
2010 Pwn2Own contest sponsored by TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.
By moving DOM nodes between documents Nils found a case where the moved
node incorrectly retained its old scope. If garbage collection could
be triggered at the right time then Firefox would later use this freed
object.</p>

<p class="note">The contest winning exploit only affects Firefox 3.6
and not earlier versions.</p>

<p><u>Updated (June 22, 2010)</u>:  Firefox 3.5, SeaMonkey 2.0, and
Thunderbird 3.0 based on earlier versions of the browser
engine were patched just in case there
is an alternate way of triggering the underlying flaw.</p>

<span class="label">Announced:</span>  October 27, 2009<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Orlando Berrera<br/>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Orlando Berrera</strong> of Sec Theory
reported that recursive creation of JavaScript web-workers can be used
to create a set of objects whose memory could be freed prior to their
use.  These conditions often result in a crash which could potentially
be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's
computer.</p>

<p class="note">Web Workers were introduced in Firefox 3.5 so this
vulnerability did not affect earlier releases such as Firefox 3.</p>

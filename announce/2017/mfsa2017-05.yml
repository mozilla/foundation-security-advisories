    impact: critical
    reporter: Nils
    description: |
      When adding a range to an object in the DOM, it is possible to use <code>addRange</code> to add the range to an incorrect root object. This triggers a use-after-free, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

    description: |
      Using SVG filters that don't use the fixed point math implementation on a target iframe, a malicious page can extract pixel values from a targeted user. This can be used to extract history information and read text values across domains. This violates same-origin policy and leads to information disclosure.

    title: Addressbar spoofing by dragging and dropping URLs
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Michal Zalewski

  CVE-2017-5425:
    title: Overly permissive Gecko Media Plugin sandbox regular expression access
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Haik Aftandilian
    description: |
      The Gecko Media Plugin sandbox allows access to local files that match specific regular expressions. On OS OX, this matching allows access to some data in subdirectories of <code>/private/var</code> that could expose personal or temporary data. This has been updated to not allow access to <code>/private/var</code> and its subdirectories. <br>*Note: this issue only affects OS X. Other operating systems are not affected.*

  CVE-2017-5426:
    title: Gecko Media Plugin sandbox is not started if seccomp-bpf filter is running
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jed Davis
    description: |
      On Linux, if the secure computing mode BPF (seccomp-bpf) filter is running when the Gecko Media Plugin sandbox is started, the sandbox fails to be applied and items that would run within the sandbox are run protected only by the running filter which is typically weak compared to the sandbox. <br>*Note: this issue only affects Linux. Other operating systems are not affected.*

    impact: moderate
    reporter: Mike Kaply
    description: |
      A non-existent chrome.manifest file will attempt to be loaded during startup from the primary installation directory. If a malicious user with local access puts chrome.manifest and other referenced files in this directory, they will be loaded and activated during startup. This could result in malicious software being added without consent or modification of referenced installed files.

  CVE-2017-5422:
    title: "DOS attack by using view-source: protocol repeatedly in one hyperlink"
    impact: low
    reporter: Alex Bolton
    description: |
      If a malicious site uses the <code>view-source:</code> protocol in a series within a single hyperlink, it can trigger a non-exploitable browser crash when the hyperlink is selected. This was fixed by no longer making <code>view-source:</code> linkable.

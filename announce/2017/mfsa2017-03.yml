    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 45.7

    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Jan de Mooij, Tom Schuster, and Oriol reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 45.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

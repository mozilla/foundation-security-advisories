  CVE-2017-7798:
    title: XUL injection in the style editor in devtools
    impact: critical
    reporter: Frederik Braun
    description: |
       The Developer Tools feature suffers from a XUL injection vulnerability due to improper sanitization of the web page source code. In the worst case, this could allow arbitrary code execution when opening a malicious page with the style editor tool.

    impact: high
    reporter: Nils
    description: |
      A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when manipulating the DOM during the resize event of an image element. If these elements have been freed due to a lack of strong references, a potentially exploitable crash may occur when the freed elements are accessed.

  CVE-2017-7804:
    title: Memory protection bypass through WindowsDllDetourPatcher
    impact: high
    reporter: Stephen Fewer
    description: |
      The destructor function for the <code>WindowsDllDetourPatcher</code> class can be re-purposed by malicious code in concert with another vulnerability to write arbitrary data to an attacker controlled location in memory. This can be used to bypass existing memory protections in this situation. <br>*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are not affected.*
    bugs:
      - url: 1372849
  CVE-2017-7791:
    title: "Spoofing following page navigation with data: protocol and modal alerts"
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jose María Acuña
    description: |
      On pages containing an iframe, the <code>data:</code> protocol can be used to create a modal alert that will render over arbitrary domains following page navigation, spoofing of the origin of the modal alert from the iframe content.
    bugs:
      - url: 1365875
  CVE-2017-7808:
    title: CSP information leak with frame-ancestors containing paths
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jun Kokatsu
    description: |
       A content security policy (CSP) <code>frame-ancestors</code> directive containing origins with paths allows for comparisons against those paths instead of the origin. This results in a cross-origin information leak of this path information.
    bugs:
      - url: 1367531
  CVE-2017-7782:
    title: WindowsDllDetourPatcher allocates memory without DEP protections
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Arthur Edelstein
    description: |
      An error in the <code>WindowsDllDetourPatcher</code> where a RWX ("Read/Write/Execute") 4k block is allocated but never protected, violating DEP protections. <br>*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are not affected.*
    bugs:
      - url: 1344034
  CVE-2017-7781:
    title: Elliptic curve point addition error when using mixed Jacobian-affine coordinates
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Antonio Sanso
    description: |
      An error occurs in the elliptic curve point addition algorithm that uses mixed Jacobian-affine coordinates where it can yield a result <code>POINT_AT_INFINITY</code> when it should not. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this to interfere with a connection, resulting in an attacked party computing an incorrect shared secret.
    bugs:
      - url: 1352039
  CVE-2017-7794:
    title: Linux file truncation via sandbox broker
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jann Horn
    description: |
      On Linux systems, if the content process is compromised, the sandbox broker will allow files to be truncated even though the sandbox explicitly only has read access to the local file system and no write permissions. <br>*Note: This attack only affects the Linux operating system. Other operating systems are not affected.*
    bugs:
      - url: 1374281
  CVE-2017-7803:
    title: CSP containing 'sandbox' improperly applied
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Rhys Enniks
    description: |
      When a page’s content security policy (CSP) header contains a <code>sandbox</code> directive, other directives are ignored. This results in the incorrect enforcement of CSP.
    bugs:
      - url: 1377426
  CVE-2017-7799:
    title: "Self-XSS XUL injection in about:webrtc" 
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Frederik Braun
    description: |
      JavaScript in the <code>about:webrtc</code> page is not sanitized properly being assigned to <code>innerHTML</code>. Data on this page is supplied by WebRTC usage and is not under third-party control, making this difficult to exploit, but the vulnerability could possibly be used for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
    bugs:
      - url: 1372509
  CVE-2017-7783:
    title: DOS attack through long username in URL
    impact: low
    reporter: Amit Sangra
    description: |
      If a long user name is used in a username/password combination in a site URL (such as <code> http://UserName:Password@example.com</code>), the resulting modal prompt will hang in a non-responsive state or crash, causing a denial of service.
    bugs:
      - url: 1360842
  CVE-2017-7788:
    title: "Sandboxed about:srcdoc iframes do not inherit CSP directives"
    impact: low
    reporter: Muneaki Nishimura
    description: |
      When an <code>iframe</code> has a <code>sandbox</code> attribute and its content is specified using <code>srcdoc</code>, that content does not inherit the containing page's Content Security Policy (CSP) as it should unless the sandbox attribute included <code>allow-same-origin</code>.
    bugs:
      - url: 1073952
  CVE-2017-7789:
    title: Failure to enable HSTS when two STS headers are sent for a connection
    impact: low
    reporter: Muneaki Nishimura
    description: |
      If a server sends two Strict-Transport-Security (STS) headers for a single connection, they will be rejected as invalid and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) will not be enabled for the connection.

      - url: 1074642
  CVE-2017-7790:
    title: Windows crash reporter reads extra memory for some non-null-terminated registry values
    impact: low
    reporter: Xiaoyin Liu
    description: |
      On Windows systems, if non-null-terminated strings are copied into the crash reporter for some specific registry keys, stack memory data can be copied until a null is found. This can potentially contain private data from the local system. <br>*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are not affected.*
    bugs:
      - url: 1350460
  CVE-2017-7796:
    title: Windows updater can delete any file named update.log
    impact: low
    reporter: Matt Howell
    description: |
      On Windows systems, the logger run by the Windows updater deletes the file "update.log" before it runs in order to write a new log of that name. The path to this file is supplied at the command line to the updater and could be used in concert with another local exploit to delete a different file named "update.log" instead of the one intended. <br>*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are not affected.*
    bugs:
      - url: 1234401
  CVE-2017-7797:
    title: Response header name interning leaks across origins
    impact: low
    reporter: Anne van Kesteren
    description: |
      Response header name interning does not have same-origin protections and these headers are stored in a global registry. This allows stored header names to be available cross-origin.

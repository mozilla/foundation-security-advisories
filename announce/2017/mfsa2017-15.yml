    title: File manipulation and privilege escalation via callback parameter in Mozilla Windows Updater and Maintenance Service
    impact: high
    reporter: Holger Fuhrmannek
    description: |
      The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access. <br>*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*
    bugs:
      - url: 1348645
  CVE-2017-7761:
    title: File deletion and privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service helper.exe application
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Holger Fuhrmannek
    description: |
      The Mozilla Maintenance Service <code>helper.exe</code> application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access. <br>*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

    title: Addressbar spoofing in Reader mode
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jun Kokatsu
    description: |

  CVE-2017-7763:
    title: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Michał Bentkowski
    description: |
      Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks. <br>*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

      - url: 1360309
  CVE-2017-7764:
    title: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Samuel Erb
    description: |
      Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

    title: Mark of the Web bypass when saving executable files
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jonathan Birch and Microsoft Vulnerability Research
    description: |
      The "Mark of the Web" was not correctly saved on Windows when files with very long names were downloaded from the Internet. Without the Mark of the Web data, the security warning that Windows displays before running executables downloaded from the Internet is not shown. <br>*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

    impact: high
    reporter: Seb Patane
    description: |
      An attack using manipulation of <code>updater.ini</code> contents, used by the Mozilla Windows Updater, and privilege escalation through the Mozilla Maintenance Service to allow for arbitrary file execution and deletion by the Maintenance Service, which has privileged access. <br>*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*
    bugs:
      - url: 1342742
  CVE-2017-7767:
    title: Privilege escalation and arbitrary file overwrites through Mozilla Windows Updater and Mozilla Maintenance Service
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Seb Patane
    description: |
      The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to overwrite arbitrary files with junk data using the Mozilla Windows Updater, which runs with the Maintenance Service's privileged access. <br>*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

  CVE-2017-7768:
    title: 32 byte arbitrary file read through Mozilla Maintenance Service
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Seb Patane
    description: |
      The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to read 32 bytes of any arbitrary file on the local system by convincing the service that it is reading a status file provided by the Mozilla Windows Updater. The Mozilla Maintenance Service executes with privileged access, bypassing system protections against unprivileged users. <br>*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

  CVE-2017-7770:
    title: Addressbar spoofing with JavaScript events and fullscreen mode
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jordi Chancel
    description: |
      A mechanism where when a new tab is loaded through JavaScript events, if fullscreen mode is then entered, the addressbar will not be rendered. This would allow a malicious site to displayed a spoofed addressbar, showing the location of an arbitrary website instead of the one loaded. <br>*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop Firefox is unaffected.*

    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Byron Campen, Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Benjamin Bouvier, Bob Clary, Jon Coppeard, and Michael Layzell reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

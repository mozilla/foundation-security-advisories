advisories:
  CVE-2025-3875:
    title: Sender Spoofing via Malformed From Header in Thunderbird
    impact: high
    reporter: xh4vm
    description: |
      Thunderbird parses addresses in a way that can allow sender
      spoofing in case the server allows an invalid From address to be
      used. For example, if the From header contains an (invalid) value
      "Spoofed Name <spoofed@example.com> <legitimate@example.com>",
      Thunderbird treats spoofed@example.com as the actual address.

  CVE-2025-3909:
    title: "JavaScript Execution via Spoofed PDF Attachment and file:/// Link"
    impact: high
    reporter: Dario Weißer
    description: |     
      Thunderbird's handling of the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header
      can be exploited to execute JavaScript in the file:/// context. By crafting a
      nested email attachment (message/rfc822) and setting its content type to
      application/pdf, Thunderbird may incorrectly render it as HTML when
      opened, allowing the embedded JavaScript to run without requiring a file
      download. This behavior relies on Thunderbird auto-saving the attachment
      to /tmp and linking to it via the file:/// protocol, potentially enabling
      JavaScript execution as part of the HTML.

  CVE-2025-3932:
    title: Tracking Links in Attachments Bypassed Remote Content Blocking
    impact: low
    reporter: Dario Weißer
    description: |
      It was possible to craft an email that showed a tracking link as an
      attachment. If the user attempted to open the attachment, Thunderbird
      automatically accessed the link. The configuration to block remote content
      did not prevent that. Thunderbird has been fixed to no longer allow access
      to web pages listed in the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header of an
      email.

  CVE-2025-5986:
    title: "Unsolicited File Download, Disk Space Exhaustion, and Credential Leakage via mailbox:/// Links"
    impact: high
    reporter: Dario Wei√üer
    description: |
      A crafted HTML email using mailbox:/// links can trigger automatic,
      unsolicited downloads of .pdf files to the user's desktop or home
      directory without prompting, even if auto-saving is disabled. This
      behavior can be abused to fill the disk with garbage data (e.g. using
      /dev/urandom on Linux) or to leak Windows credentials via SMB links
      when the email is viewed in HTML mode. While user interaction is
      required to download the .pdf file, visual obfuscation can conceal
      the download trigger. Viewing the email in HTML mode is enough to
      load external content.

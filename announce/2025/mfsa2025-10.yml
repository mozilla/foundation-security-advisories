  CVE-2025-1015:
    title: Unsanitized address book fields
    impact: low
    reporter: r3m0t3nu11
    description: |
      The Thunderbird Address Book URI fields contained unsanitized links. This could be used by an attacker to create and export an address book containing a malicious payload in a field. For example, in the “Other” field of the Instant Messaging section. If another user imported the address book, clicking on the link could result in opening a web page inside Thunderbird, and that page could execute (unprivileged) JavaScript.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 135, Thunderbird 135, Firefox ESR 115.20, Firefox ESR 128.7, Thunderbird 115.20, and Thunderbird 128.7
    impact: high

  CVE-2025-6427:
    title: connect-src Content Security Policy restriction could be bypassed
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Alan Li (lebr0nli)
    description: |
      An attacker was able to bypass the <code>connect-src</code> directive of a Content Security Policy by manipulating subdocuments. This would have also hidden the connections from the Network tab in Devtools.

  CVE-2025-6429:
    title: Incorrect parsing of URLs could have allowed embedding of youtube.com
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Masato Kinugawa
    description: |
      Thunderbird could have incorrectly parsed a URL and rewritten it to the youtube.com domain when parsing the URL specified in an <code>embed</code> tag.  This could have bypassed website security checks that restricted which domains users were allowed to embed.

      - url: 1970658
  CVE-2025-6430:
    title: Content-Disposition header ignored when a file is included in an embed or object tag
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Daniil Satyaev (Positive Technologies)
    description: |
      When a file download is specified via the <code>Content-Disposition</code> header, that directive would be ignored if the file was included via a <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag, potentially making a website vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.

  CVE-2025-6432:
    title: DNS Requests leaked outside of a configured SOCKS proxy
    impact: low
    reporter: Albert
    description: |
      When Multi-Account Containers was enabled, DNS requests could have bypassed a SOCKS proxy when the domain name was invalid or the SOCKS proxy was not responding.

  CVE-2025-6433:
    title: WebAuthn would allow a user to sign a challenge on a webpage with an invalid TLS certificate
    impact: low
    reporter: Simon
    description: |
      If a user visited a webpage with an invalid TLS certificate, and granted an exception, the webpage was able to provide a WebAuthn challenge that the user would be prompted to complete.  This is in violation of the WebAuthN spec which requires "a secure transport established without errors".

      - url: 1954033
  CVE-2025-6434:
    title: HTTPS-Only exception screen lacked anti-clickjacking delay
    impact: low
    reporter: hafiizh & kang ali
    description: |
      The exception page for the HTTPS-Only feature, displayed when a website is opened via HTTP, lacked an anti-clickjacking delay, potentially allowing an attacker to trick a user into granting an exception and loading a webpage over HTTP.

      - url: 1955182
  CVE-2025-6435:
    title: Save as in Devtools could download files without sanitizing the extension
    impact: low
    reporter: Ameen Basha M K
    description: |
      If a user saved a response from the Network tab in Devtools using the Save As context menu option, that file may not have been saved with the <code>.download</code> file extension. This could have led to the user inadvertently running a malicious executable.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 140 and Thunderbird 140
    impact: high
    reporter: Andrew McCreight, Gabriele Svelto, Beth Rennie (she/her), Steven Michaud, the Mozilla Fuzzing Team
    description: |
      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 139 and Thunderbird 139. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

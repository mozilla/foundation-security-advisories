  CVE-2025-2817:
    title: Privilege escalation in Firefox Updater
    impact: high
    reporter: Dong-uk Kim (@justlikebono)
    description: |
      Mozilla Firefox's update mechanism allowed a medium-integrity user process to interfere with the SYSTEM-level updater by manipulating the file-locking behavior. By injecting code into the user-privileged process, an attacker could bypass intended access controls, allowing SYSTEM-level file operations on paths controlled by a non-privileged user and enabling privilege escalation.

  MFSA-RESERVE-2025-1958350:
    title: Process isolation bypass using "javascript:" URI links in cross-origin frames
    impact: high
    reporter: Nika Layzell
    description: |
      A process isolation vulnerability in Firefox stemmed from improper handling of javascript: URIs, which could allow content to execute in the top-level document's process instead of the intended frame, potentially enabling a sandbox escape.

  MFSA-RESERVE-2025-1949994:
    title: Potential local code execution in "copy as cURL" command
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ameen Basha M K
    description: |
      Due to insufficient escaping of the ampersand character in the "copy as cURL" feature, an attacker could trick a user into using this command, potentially leading to local code execution on the user's system.<br>*This bug only affects Firefox for Windows. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

  CVE-2025-2817:
    title: Privilege escalation in Thunderbird Updater
    impact: high
    reporter: Dong-uk Kim (@justlikebono)
    description: |
      Thunderbird's update mechanism allowed a medium-integrity user process to interfere with the SYSTEM-level updater by manipulating the file-locking behavior. By injecting code into the user-privileged process, an attacker could bypass intended access controls, allowing SYSTEM-level file operations on paths controlled by a non-privileged user and enabling privilege escalation.

  CVE-2025-4082:
    title: WebGL shader attribute memory corruption in Thunderbird for macOS
    impact: high
    reporter: un3xploitable & GF
    description: |
      Modification of specific WebGL shader attributes could trigger an out-of-bounds read, which, when chained with other vulnerabilities, could be used to escalate privileges.<br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird for macOS. Other versions of Thunderbird are unaffected.*

  CVE-2025-4083:
    title: |
      Process isolation bypass using "javascript:" URI links in cross-origin frames
    impact: high
    reporter: Nika Layzell
    description: |
      A process isolation vulnerability in Thunderbird stemmed from improper handling of javascript: URIs, which could allow content to execute in the top-level documentâ€™s process instead of the intended frame, potentially enabling a sandbox escape.

  CVE-2025-4084:
    title: Potential local code execution in "copy as cURL" command
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ameen Basha M K
    description: |
      Due to insufficient escaping of the special characters in the "copy as cURL" feature, an attacker could trick a user into using this command, potentially leading to local code execution on the user's system.<br>*This bug only affects Firefox for Windows. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

  CVE-2025-4087:
    title: Unsafe attribute access during XPath parsing
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ivan Fratric
    description: |
      A vulnerability was identified in Thunderbird where XPath parsing could trigger undefined behavior due to missing null checks during attribute access. This could lead to out-of-bounds read access and potentially, memory corruption.

  CVE-2025-4091:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 138, Thunderbird 138, Firefox ESR 128.10, and Thunderbird 128.10
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Maurice Dauer and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team
    description: |
      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 137, Thunderbird 137, Firefox ESR 128.9, and Thunderbird 128.9. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

  CVE-2025-3522:
    title: Leak of hashed Window credentials via crafted attachment URL
    impact: high
    reporter: Dario Weißer
    description: |
      Thunderbird processes the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header
      to handle attachments which can be hosted externally. When an
      email is opened, Thunderbird accesses the specified URL to 
      determine file size, and navigates to it when the user clicks the
      attachment. Because the URL is not validated or sanitized, it can
      reference internal resources like chrome:// or SMB share file:// links,
      potentially leading to hashed Windows credential leakage and opening the
      door to more serious security issues.

  CVE-2025-2830:
    title: Information Disclosure of /tmp directory listing
    impact: high
    reporter: Dario Weißer
    description: |
      By crafting a malformed file name for an attachment in a multipart
      message, an attacker can trick Thunderbird into including a
      directory listing of /tmp when the message is forwarded or edited
      as a new message. This vulnerability could allow attackers to
      disclose sensitive information from the victim's system. This
      vulnerability is not limited to Linux; similar behavior has been
      observed on Windows as well.

  CVE-2025-3523:
    title: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of attachment URL
    impact: low
    reporter: Dario Weißer
    description: |
      When an email contains multiple attachments with external links
      via the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header, only the last
      link is shown when hovering over any attachment. Although the
      correct link is used on click, the misleading hover text could
      trick users into downloading content from untrusted sources.

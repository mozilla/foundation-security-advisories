    title: Incorrect handle could lead to sandbox escapes
    impact: critical
    reporter: Andrew McCreight
    description: |
      Following the recent Chrome sandbox escape (CVE-2025-2783), various Firefox
      developers identified a similar pattern in our IPC code. A compromised child
      process could cause the parent process to return an unintentionally
      powerful handle, leading to a sandbox escape.
      <br>The original vulnerability was being exploited in the wild.
      <br>*This only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

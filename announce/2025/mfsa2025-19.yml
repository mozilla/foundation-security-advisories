    title: Incorrect handle could lead to sandbox escapes
    impact: critical
    reporter: Andrew McCreight
    description: |
      Following the sandbox escape in CVE-2025-2783, various Firefox developers
      identified a similar pattern in our IPC code. Attackers were able to
      confuse the parent process into leaking handles to unprivileged child
      processes leading to a sandbox escape.
      <br>The original vulnerability was being exploited in the wild.
      <br>*This only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2025-6429:
    title: Incorrect parsing of URLs could have allowed embedding of youtube.com
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Masato Kinugawa
    description: |
      Thunderbird could have incorrectly parsed a URL and rewritten it to the youtube.com domain when parsing the URL specified in an <code>embed</code> tag.  This could have bypassed website security checks that restricted which domains users were allowed to embed.
    bugs:
      - url: 1970658
  CVE-2025-6430:
    title: Content-Disposition header ignored when a file is included in an embed or object tag
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Daniil Satyaev (Positive Technologies)
    description: |
      When a file download is specified via the <code>Content-Disposition</code> header, that directive would be ignored if the file was included via a <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag, potentially making a website vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.

  CVE-2021-38505:
    title: Windows 10 Cloud Clipboard may have recorded sensitive user data
    impact: high
    reporter: Sergey Galich
    description: |
      Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account.<br>*This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2021-38507:
    title: Opportunistic Encryption in HTTP2 could be used to bypass the Same-Origin-Policy on services hosted on other ports
    impact: high
    reporter: Takeshi Terada
    description: |
      The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80.  However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP.  This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage.

    reporter: Raphael

  CVE-2021-43534:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 94 and Firefox ESR 91.3
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Valentin Gosu, and Andrew McCreight reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 93 and Firefox ESR 91.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, and Gabriele Svelto reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 78.13.0. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

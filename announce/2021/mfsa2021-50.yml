title: Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 91.3
description: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*<br />This advisory was updated January 17, 2023 to add CVE-2021-43529. This fix was included in the original release of Thunderbird 91.3, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

     title:  Memory corruption when processing S/MIME messages
     impact: critical
     reporter: Tavis Ormandy
     description: |
       Thunderbird versions prior to 91.3.0 are vulnerable to the heap overflow described in CVE-2021-43527 when processing S/MIME messages. Thunderbird versions 91.3.0 and later will not call the vulnerable code when processing S/MIME messages that contain certificates with DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures.<br>Note: This advisory was added on January 17, 2023 after discovering it was inadvertently left out of the original advisory. The fix was included in the original release of Thunderbird 91.3.

  CVE-2021-38505:
    title: Windows 10 Cloud Clipboard may have recorded sensitive user data
    impact: high
    reporter: Sergey Galich
    description: |
      Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Thunderbird before version 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account.<br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2021-38507:
    title: Opportunistic Encryption in HTTP2 could be used to bypass the Same-Origin-Policy on services hosted on other ports
    impact: high
    reporter: Takeshi Terada
    description: |
      The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80.  However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP.  This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage.

    title: Permission Prompt could be overlaid, resulting in user confusion and potential spoofing
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Raphael

      By displaying a form validity message in the correct location at the same time as a permission prompt (such as for geolocation), the validity message could have obscured the prompt, resulting in the user potentially being tricked into granting the permission.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird ESR 91.3
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Valentin Gosu, and Andrew McCreight reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 91.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

title: Code execution via QuickTime Media-link files

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>On his blog <a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/0day-quicktime-pwns-firefox"><strong>Petko D. Petkov</strong> reported</a> that QuickTime Media-Link files contain a <code>qtnext</code>
attribute that could be used on Windows systems to launch the default browser
with arbitrary command-line options. When the default browser is
Firefox 2.0.0.6 or earlier use of the <code>-chrome</code> option allowed a remote
attacker to run script commands with the full privileges of the user. This
could be used to install malware, steal local data, or otherwise corrupt
the victim's computer.</p>

<p>The fix for <a href="mfsa2007-23.html">MFSA 2007-23</a> was intended
to prevent this type of attack but QuickTime calls the browser in an
unexpected way that bypasses that fix. To protect Firefox users from
this problem we have now eliminated the ability to run arbitrary script
from the command-line. Other command-line options remain, however,
and QuickTime Media-link files could still be used to annoy users
with popup windows and dialogs until this issue is fixed
in QuickTime.</p>

<p>This QuickTime issue appears to be the one described by
<a class="ex-ref" href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4965">
CVE-2006-4965</a> but the fix Apple applied in QuickTime 7.1.5
does not prevent this version of the problem.</p>

<p class="note">Gran Paradiso Alpha 8 does not contain the fix
for this vulnerability.
</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disabling JavaScript in the browser does <em>not</em> protect against this
attack; in vulnerable versions scripts passed through the <code>-chrome</code>
option would be executed regardless of the JavaScript setting for web content,
much as interpreters for languages such as <strong>perl</strong> and
<strong>Python</strong> execute scripts passed on the command line.
The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/722">
NoScript add-on</a>, however, has provided protection against this class of
attack since the cross-browser vulnerabilities described by MFSA 2007-23
were discovered.</p>

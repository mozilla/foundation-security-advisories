title: Firefox default start page UI content invokable by script
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Yazan Tommalieh</strong> discovered a flaw that once users have
viewed the default Firefox start page (about:home), subsequent pages they
navigate to in that same tab could use script to activate the buttons that were
on the about:home page. Most of these simply open Firefox dialogs such as
Settings or History, which might alarm users. In some cases a malicious page
could trigger session restore and cause data loss if the current tabs are
replaced by a previously stored set.

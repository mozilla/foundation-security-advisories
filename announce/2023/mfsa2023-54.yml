    title: Potential sandbox escape due to VideoBridge lack of texture validation
    impact: moderate

  CVE-2023-6867:
    title: Clickjacking permission prompts using the popup transition
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Hafiizh
    description: |
      The timing of a button click causing a popup to disappear was approximately the same length as the anti-clickjacking delay on permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring them to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear.

    description: |
      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120, Firefox ESR 115.5, and Thunderbird 115.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

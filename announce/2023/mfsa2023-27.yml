  CVE-2023-3417:
    title: File Extension Spoofing using the Text Direction Override Character
    impact: moderate
    reporter: 이준성 (Junsung Lee)
    description: |
      Thunderbird allowed the Text Direction Override Unicode Character in filenames.
      An email attachment could be incorrectly shown as being a document file, while in 
      fact it was an executable file. Newer versions of Thunderbird will strip the character
      and show the correct file extension.

  CVE-2023-3482:
    title: Block all cookies bypass for localstorage
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Martin Hostettler
    description: |
      When Firefox is configured to block storage of all cookies, it was still possible to store data in localstorage by using an iframe with a source of 'about:blank'. This could have led to malicious websites storing tracking data without permission.

    title: Use-after-free in `NotifyOnHistoryReload`
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Simon Descarpentries
    description: |
      A use-after-free condition existed in `NotifyOnHistoryReload` where a `LoadingSessionHistoryEntry` object was freed and a reference to that object remained.  This resulted in a potentially exploitable condition when the reference to that object was later reused.

    description: |
      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 114, Firefox ESR 102.12, and Thunderbird 102.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

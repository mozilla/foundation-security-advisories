title: Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 102.8

  *Except for CVE-2023--0616, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*
advisories:
  CVE-2023-0616:
    title: User Interface lockup with messages combining S/MIME and OpenPGP
    impact: low
    reporter: Kai Engert
    description: |
      If a MIME email combines OpenPGP and OpenPGP MIME data in a certain way Thunderbird repeatedly attempts to process and display the message, which could cause Thunderbird's user interface to lock up and no longer respond to the user's actions. An attacker could send a crafted message with this structure to attempt a DoS attack.

  CVE-2023-25738:
    title: Printing on Windows could potentially crash Thunderbird with some device drivers
    impact: high
    reporter: Mark
    description: |
      Members of the <code>DEVMODEW</code> struct set by the printer device driver weren't being validated and could have resulted in invalid values which in turn would cause the browser to attempt out of bounds access to related variables.<br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

    impact: high

  CVE-2023-25729:
    title: Extensions could have opened external schemes without user knowledge
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Vitor Torres
    description: |
      Permission prompts for opening external schemes were only shown for <code>ContentPrincipals</code> resulting in extensions being able to open them without user interaction via <code>ExpandedPrincipals</code>. This could lead to further malicious actions such as downloading files or interacting with software already installed on the system.

  CVE-2023-25734:
    title: Opening local .url files could cause unexpected network loads
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ameen Basha M K and Shaheen Fazim
    description: |
      After downloading a Windows <code>.url</code> shortcut from the local filesystem, an attacker could supply a remote path that would lead to unexpected network requests from the operating system.  This also had the potential to leak NTLM credentials to the resource.<br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

    title: Arbitrary file read from GTK drag and drop on Linux
    impact: high
    reporter: Tom Schuster
    description: |

  CVE-2023-23601:
    title: URL being dragged from cross-origin iframe into same tab triggers navigation
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Luan Herrera

      Navigations were being allowed when dragging a URL from a cross-origin iframe into the same tab which could lead to website spoofing attacks
    bugs:

  CVE-2023-23602:
    title: Content Security Policy wasn't being correctly applied to WebSockets in WebWorkers
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Dave Vandyke
    description: |
      A mishandled security check when creating a WebSocket in a WebWorker caused the Content Security Policy connect-src header to be ignored. This could lead to connections to restricted origins from inside WebWorkers.
    bugs:
      - url: 1800890
  CVE-2022-46877:
    title: Fullscreen notification bypass
    impact: low
    reporter: Hafiizh
    description: |
      By confusing the browser, the fullscreen notification could have been delayed or suppressed, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.
    bugs:
      - url: 1795139
  CVE-2023-23603:
    title: Calls to console.log allowed bypassing Content Security Policy via format directive
    impact: low
    reporter: Dan Veditz
    description: |
      Regular expressions used to filter out forbidden properties and values from style directives in calls to <code>console.log</code> weren't accounting for external URLs. Data could then be potentially exfiltrated from the browser.

  CVE-2023-23605:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 102.7
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 102.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

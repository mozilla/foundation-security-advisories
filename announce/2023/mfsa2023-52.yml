    title: Clickjacking permission prompts using the fullscreen transition
    impact: high
    reporter: Hafiizh
    description: |
      The black fade animation when exiting fullscreen is roughly
      the length of the anti-clickjacking delay on permission prompts.
      It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring them
      to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear.

      path-traversal "/../" part in the path could be used to override the
      specified host. This could contribute to security problems in web sites.

    description: |
      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 119, Firefox 115.4, and Thunderbird 115.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

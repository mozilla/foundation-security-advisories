  CVE-2023-23597:
    title: Logic bug in process allocation allowed to read arbitrary files
    impact: high
    reporter: Niklas Baumstark
    description: |
      A compromised web child process could disable web security opening restrictions, leading to a new child process being spawned within the <code>file://</code> context. Given a reliable exploit primitive, this new process could be exploited again leading to arbitrary file read.

    title: Notification permissions persisted between Normal and Private Browsing on Android
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Kazuki Nomoto of Waseda University
    description: |
      Per origin notification permissions were being stored in a way that didn't take into account what browsing context the permission was granted in. This lead to the possibility of notifications to be displayed during different browsing sessions.<br>*This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

    title: Content Security Policy wasn't being correctly applied to WebSockets in WebWorkers
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Dave Vandyke
    description: |
      A mishandled security check when creating a WebSocket in a WebWorker caused the Content Security Policy connect-src header to be ignored. This could lead to connections to restricted origins from inside WebWorkers.

  CVE-2023-23603:
    title: Calls to console.log allowed bypassing Content Security Policy via format directive
    impact: low
    reporter: Dan Veditz
    description: |
      Regular expressions used to filter out forbidden properties and values from style directives in calls to <code>console.log</code> weren't accounting for external URLs. Data could then be potentially exfiltrated from the browser.

  CVE-2023-23604:
    title: Creation of duplicate SystemPrincipal from less secure contexts
    impact: low
    reporter: Nika Layzell
    description: |
      A duplicate <code>SystemPrincipal</code> object could be created when parsing a non-system html document via <code>DOMParser::ParseFromSafeString</code>. This could have lead to bypassing web security checks.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 109 and Firefox ESR 102.7
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 108 and Firefox ESR 102.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

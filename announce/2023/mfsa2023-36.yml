    title: Memory corruption in IPC CanvasTranslator
    impact: high
    reporter: sonakkbi

  CVE-2023-4574:
    title: Memory corruption in IPC ColorPickerShownCallback
    impact: high
    reporter: sonakkbi
    description: |
      When creating a callback over IPC for showing the Color Picker window, multiple of the same callbacks could have been created at a time and eventually all simultaneously destroyed as soon as one of the callbacks finished. This could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2023-4578:
    title: Error reporting methods in SpiderMonkey could have triggered an Out of Memory Exception
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
    description: |
      When calling <code>JS::CheckRegExpSyntax</code> a Syntax Error could have been set which would end in calling <code>convertToRuntimeErrorAndClear</code>. A path in the function could attempt to allocate memory when none is available which would have caused a newly created Out of Memory exception to be mishandled as a Syntax Error.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 117, Firefox ESR 102.15, Firefox ESR 115.2, Thunderbird 102.15, and Thunderbird 115.2
    impact: high
    reporter: Randell Jesup, Andrew McCreight, the Mozilla Fuzzing Team

      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 116, Firefox ESR 102.14, Firefox ESR 115.1, Thunderbird 102.14, and Thunderbird 115.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

    title: CSS-based exfiltration of the content from partially encrypted emails when allowing remote content
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Leon Trampert, Daniel Weber, Christian Rossow, Michael Schwarz
    description: |
      When a user explicitly requested Thunderbird to decrypt an inline
      OpenPGP message that was embedded in a text section of an email
      that was formatted and styled with HTML and CSS, then the
      decrypted contents were rendered in a context in which the CSS
      styles from the outer messages were active. If the user had
      additionally allowed loading of the remote content referenced by
      the outer email message, and the email was crafted by the sender
      using a combination of CSS rules and fonts and animations, then
      it was possible to extract the secret contents of the email.

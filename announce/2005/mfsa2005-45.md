title: Content-generated event vulnerabilities
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In several places the browser UI did not correctly distinguish between true
user events, such as mouse clicks or keystrokes, and synthetic events
generated by web content. The problems ranged from minor annoyances like
switching tabs or entering full-screen mode, to a variant on <a href="mfsa2005-34.html">MFSA 2005-34</a></p>

<p>Synthetic events are now prevented from reaching the browser UI entirely
rather than depend on each potentially spoofed function to protect
itself from untrusted events.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

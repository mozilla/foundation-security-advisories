title: Spoofing download and security dialogs with overlapping windows
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Michael Krax demonstrates that the download dialog and security dialogs
can be spoofed by partially covering them with an overlapping window.
Some users may not notice the OS window border and browser statusbar
bisecting what appears to be a single dialog, and be convinced by the
spoofing text of the top-most window to click on the "Allow" or "Open"
button of the window below.</p>

<p>If the security dialog button is clicked signed scripts could perform
any action on the users machine.</p>

<p>If the download button is clicked a file could be downloaded to the
default download location. If the target file MIME type is one handled
by a helper app clicking the button could launch that helper app. If
there's a known exploit in a popular or default helper app then opening
the attackers file in that app could take advantage of that exploit.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Carefully inspect dialogs triggered by web content.</p>

<p>Disable the ability of web pages to resize and position windows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the "Options..." item on the "Tools" menu</li>
<li>Select the "Web Features" icon</li>
<li>Press the "Advanced..." button on the line with the Javascript checkbox</li>
<li>Uncheck "Raise or lower windows"</li>
<li>Uncheck "Move or resize existing windows"</li>
<li>Click OK on both dialogs to save the settings</li>
</ol>

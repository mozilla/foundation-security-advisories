title: Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 91.11
description: |
   *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.* 
   *Note*: While [Bug 1771084](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1771084) does not represent a specific vulnerability that was fixed, we recommend anyone rebasing patches to include it. 102 branch: Patch [1](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/82e3067ad2e7) and [2](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/6e4639dc3614). 91 Branch: Patch [1](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr91/rev/72bca7a337e4) and [2](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr91/rev/befef01949f2) (Despite saying Parts 2 and 3, there is no Part 1)

  CVE-2022-2226:
    title: An email with a mismatching OpenPGP signature date was accepted as valid
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Nickolay Olshevsky
    description: |
      An OpenPGP digital signature includes information about the date when the signature was created. When displaying an email that contains a digital signature, the email's date will be shown. If the dates were different, then Thunderbird didn't report the email as having an invalid signature. If an attacker performed a replay attack, in which an old email with old contents are resent at a later time, it could lead the victim to believe that the statements in the email are current. Fixed versions of Thunderbird will require that the signature's date roughly matches the displayed date of the email.

    title: CSP bypass enabling stylesheet injection

    title: Unavailable PAC file resulted in OCSP requests being blocked
    impact: moderate

  CVE-2022-34478:
    title: Microsoft protocols can be attacked if a user accepts a prompt
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Gijs
    description: |
      The <code>ms-msdt</code>, <code>search</code>, and <code>search-ms</code> protocols deliver content to Microsoft applications, bypassing the browser, when a user accepts a prompt. These applications have had known vulnerabilities, exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited through Thunderbird), so in this release Thunderbird has blocked these protocols from prompting the user to open them.<br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

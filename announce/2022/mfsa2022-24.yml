  CVE-2022-34482:
    title: Drag and drop of malicious image could have led to malicious executable and potential code execution
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Attila Suszter
    description: |
      An attacker who could have convinced a user to drag and drop an image to a filesystem could have manipulated the resulting filename to contain an executable extension, and by extension potentially tricked the user into executing malicious code.  While very similar, this is a separate issue from CVE-2022-34483.

    impact: moderate
    reporter: Amazon Malvertising Team

  CVE-2022-34469:
    title: TLS certificate errors on HSTS-protected domains could be bypassed by the user on Firefox for Android
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Peter Gerber
    description: |
      When a TLS Certificate error occurs on a domain protected by the HSTS header, the browser should not allow the user to bypass the certificate error.  On Firefox for Android, the user was presented with the option to bypass the error; this could only have been done by the user explicitly. <br>*This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2022-34478:
    title: Microsoft protocols can be attacked if a user accepts a prompt
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Gijs
    description: |
      The <code>ms-msdt</code>, <code>search</code>, and <code>search-ms</code> protocols deliver content to Microsoft applications, bypassing the browser, when a user accepts a prompt. These applications have had known vulnerabilities, exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited through Firefox), so in this release Firefox has blocked these protocols from prompting the user to open them.<br>*This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

    impact: low

    title: HTML Sanitizer could have been bypassed via same-origin script via use tags
    impact: low
    reporter: Gareth Heyes
    description: |
      SVG <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> tags that referenced a same-origin document could have resulted in script execution if attacker input was sanitized via the HTML Sanitizer API. This would have required the attacker to reference a same-origin JavaScript file containing the script to be executed.

    title: HTML Sanitizer could have been bypassed via use tags

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 102 and Firefox ESR 91.11
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      The Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities present in Firefox 101 and Firefox ESR 91.10. Some of these bugs showed evidence of JavaScript prototype or memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

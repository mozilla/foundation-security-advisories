    title: Microsoft protocols can be attacked if a user accepts a prompt

    reporter: Gijs
    description: |
      The <code>ms-msdt</code>, <code>search</code>, and <code>search-ms</code> protocols deliver content to Microsoft applications, bypassing the browser, when a user accepts a prompt. These applications have had known vulnerabilities, exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited through Firefox), so in this release Firefox has blocked these protocols from prompting the user to open them.<br>*This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

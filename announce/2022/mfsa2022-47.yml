title: Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 107
description: |
  This advisory was updated December 13, 2022 to add CVE-2022-46882 and CVE-2022-46883. Both fixes were included in the original release of Firefox 107, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.
advisories:
  CVE-2022-45403:
    title: Service Workers might have learned size of cross-origin media files
    impact: high
    reporter: Anne van Kesteren and Karl Tomlinson
    description: |
      Service Workers should not be able to infer information about opaque cross-origin responses; but timing information for cross-origin media combined with Range requests might have allowed them to determine the presence or length of a media file.

  CVE-2022-45404:
    title: Fullscreen notification bypass
    impact: high
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      Through a series of popup and <code>window.print()</code> calls, an attacker can cause a window to go fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.

  CVE-2022-45405:
    title: Use-after-free in InputStream implementation
    impact: high
    reporter: Atte Kettunen
    description: |
      Freeing arbitrary <code>nsIInputStream</code>'s on a different thread than creation could have led to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2022-45406:
    title: Use-after-free of a JavaScript Realm
    impact: high
    reporter: Samuel Gro√ü
    description: |
      If an out-of-memory condition occurred when creating a JavaScript global, a JavaScript realm may be deleted while references to it lived on in a BaseShape. This could lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2022-45407:
    title: Loading fonts on workers was not thread-safe
    impact: high
    reporter: Armin Ebert
    description: |
      If an attacker loaded a font using <code>FontFace()</code> on a background worker, a use-after-free could have occurred, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2022-45408:
    title: Fullscreen notification bypass via windowName
    impact: high
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      Through a series of popups that reuse windowName, an attacker can cause a window to go fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.

  CVE-2022-45409:
    title: Use-after-free in Garbage Collection
    impact: high
    reporter: Gary Kwong
    description: |
      The garbage collector could have been aborted in several states and zones and <code>GCRuntime::finishCollection</code> may not have been called, leading to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash

  CVE-2022-45410:
    title: ServiceWorker-intercepted requests bypassed SameSite cookie policy
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Dongsung Kim
    description: |
      When a ServiceWorker intercepted a request with <code>FetchEvent</code>, the origin of the request was lost after the ServiceWorker took ownership of it.  This had the effect of negating SameSite cookie protections.  This was addressed in the spec and then in browsers.

      - url: 1658869
  CVE-2022-45411:
    title: Cross-Site Tracing was possible via non-standard override headers
    impact: moderate
    reporter: scarlet
    description: |
      Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly).  To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again.  Firefox has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers.

  CVE-2022-45412:
    title: Symlinks may resolve to partially uninitialized buffers
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Armin Ebert
    description: |
      When resolving a symlink such as <code>file:///proc/self/fd/1</code>, an error message may be produced where the symlink was resolved to a string containing uninitialized memory in the buffer. <br>*This bug only affects Firefox on Unix-based operated systems (Android, Linux, MacOS). Windows is unaffected.*

      - url: 1791029
  CVE-2022-45413:
    title: SameSite=Strict cookies could have been sent cross-site via intent URLs
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Axel Chong
    description: |
      Using the <code>S.browser_fallback_url parameter</code> parameter, an attacker could redirect a user to a URL and cause SameSite=Strict cookies to be sent.<br>*This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are not affected.*

  CVE-2022-40674:
    title: Use-after-free vulnerability in expat
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Rhodri James
    description: |
      A flaw in XML parsing could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.<br>*In official releases of Firefox this vulnerability is mitigated by wasm sandboxing; versions managed by Linux distributions may have other settings.*

  CVE-2022-45415:
    title: Downloaded file may have been saved with malicious extension
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jefferson Scher and Jayateertha Guruprasad
    description: |
      When downloading an HTML file, if the title of the page was formatted as a filename with a malicious extension, Firefox may have saved the file with that extension, leading to possible system compromise if the downloaded file was later ran.
    bugs:
      - url: 1793551
  CVE-2022-45416:
    title: Keystroke Side-Channel Leakage
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Erik Kraft, Martin Schwarzl, and Andrew McCreight
    description: |
      Keyboard events reference strings like "KeyA" that were at fixed, known, and widely-spread addresses. Cache-based timing attacks such as Prime+Probe could have possibly figured out which keys were being pressed.
    bugs:
      - url: 1793676
  CVE-2022-45417:
    title: Service Workers in Private Browsing Mode may have been written to disk
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Kagami
    description: |
      Service Workers did not detect Private Browsing Mode correctly in all cases, which could have led to Service Workers being written to disk for websites visited in Private Browsing Mode.  This would not have persisted them in a state where they would run again, but it would have leaked Private Browsing Mode details to disk.
    bugs:
      - url: 1794508
  CVE-2022-45418:
    title: Custom mouse cursor could have been drawn over browser UI
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Hafiizh
    description: |
      If a custom mouse cursor is specified in CSS, under certain circumstances the cursor could have been drawn over the browser UI, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.

  CVE-2022-46882:
    title: Use-after-free in WebGL
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      A use-after-free in WebGL extensions could have led to a potentially exploitable crash.<br />*Note*: This advisory was added on December 13th, 2022 after we better understood the impact of the issue. The fix was included in the original release of Firefox 107.
    bugs:
      - url: 1789371
  CVE-2022-45419:
    title: Deleting a security exception did not take effect immediately
    impact: low
    reporter: Ronald Crane
    description: |
      If the user added a security exception for an invalid TLS certificate, opened an ongoing TLS connection with a server that used that certificate, and then deleted the exception, Firefox would have kept the connection alive, making it seem like the certificate was still trusted.

  CVE-2022-45420:
    title: Iframe contents could be rendered outside the iframe
    impact: low
    reporter: Suhwan Song of SNU CompSec Lab
    description: |
      Using tables inside of an iframe, an attacker could have caused iframe contents to be rendered outside the boundaries of the iframe, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 107 and Firefox ESR 102.5
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Gabriele Svelto reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 106 and Firefox ESR 102.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

title: XSS hazard using SVG document and binary Content-Type
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>Georgi Guninski</strong>
reported that when a SVG document which is served
with <code>Content-Type: application/octet-stream</code> is embedded
into another document via an <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tag
with <code>type="image/svg+xml"</code>, the Content-Type is ignored
and the SVG document is processed normally.  A website which allows
arbitrary binary data to be uploaded but which relies
on <code>Content-Type: application/octet-stream</code> to prevent
script execution could have such protection bypassed.  An attacker
could upload a SVG document containing JavaScript as a binary file to
a website, embed the SVG document into a malicious page on another
site, and gain access to the script environment from the SVG-serving
site, bypassing the same-origin policy.</p>

title: Crash in proxy auto-configuration regexp parsing
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Marco C.</strong> reported a flaw in
the parsing of regular expressions used in Proxy Auto-configuration
(PAC) files.  In certain cases this flaw could be used by an attacker
to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on their computer.
Since this vulnerability requires the victim to have PAC configured in
their environment with specific regular expressions which can trigger
the crash, the severity of the issue was determined to be
moderate.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.</p>

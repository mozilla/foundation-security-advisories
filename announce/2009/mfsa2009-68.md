title: NTLM reflection vulnerability
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Takehiro Takahashi</strong> of the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application
could be forwarded to another arbitrary application via the browser.
If an attacker could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he
could force NTLM authenticated requests to be forwarded to another
application on behalf of the user.</p>

title: SSL tampering via non-200 responses to proxy CONNECT requests
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Microsoft security researchers <strong>Shuo
Chen</strong>, <strong>Ziqing Mao</strong>, <strong>Yi-Min
Wang</strong>, and <strong>Ming Zhang</strong> reported that when a
CONNECT request is sent to a proxy server and a non-200 response is
returned, then the body of the response is incorrectly rendered
within the context of the request <code>Host:</code> header.  An
active network attacker could use this vulnerability to intercept a
CONNECT request and reply with a non-200 response containing malicious
code which would be executed within the context of the victim's
requested SSL-protected domain.  Since this attack requires the victim
to have a proxy configured, the severity of this issue was determined
to be high.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird mail messages are not vulnerable to this flaw,
but if Thunderbird were being used in a browser-like manner (through Add-ons,
perhaps) and JavaScript were enabled (not the default settng) then users could
be vulnerable to this flaw in older versions.

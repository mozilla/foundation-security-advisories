title: Loading privileged content through Reader mode
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Armin Razmdjou</strong> reported a flaw in
<code>Reader mode</code> on Firefox for Android. Reader mode reformats web
content for easy readability and operates as unprivileged content that is the
equivalent of the formatted content. When Reader mode is unable to process
content, it displays the original web pages. Since it is unprivileged, there are
no restrictions on pages linking to or framing Reader mode content. The reported
flaw is that privileged URLs can be passed to Reader mode and bypass the normal
restrictions that prevent web pages from obtaining references to privileged
contexts. If this issue was combined with another flaw that allowed for a
violation of the same-origin policy, then the resulting combination could lead
to arbitrary code execution.
</p>

<p class="note">This flaw only affects Firefox for Android and pre-release
versions of Desktop Firefox. The released version of desktop Firefox does not
have reader mode and is not affected.

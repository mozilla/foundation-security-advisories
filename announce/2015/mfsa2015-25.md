title: Local files or privileged URLs in pages can be opened into new tabs
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Armin Ebert</strong> reported that opening
hyperlinks on a page with the mouse and specific keyboard key combinations could
allow a Chrome privileged URL to be opened without context restrictions being
preserved. This could also allow for local files or resources from a known
location to be opened with local privileges, bypassing security
protections.

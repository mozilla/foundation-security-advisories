title: Add-on lightweight theme installation approval bypassed through MITM attack
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Armin Razmdjou</strong> discovered that a
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker spoofing a Mozilla sub-domain could bypass
user approval messages to install a Firefox lightweight theme. This was possible
because add-on installations of the lightweight themes do not require the use of
HTTP over SSL. Firefox extensions were not directly affected and still required
user approval for installation.

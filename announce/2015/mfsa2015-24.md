title: Reading of local files through manipulation of form autocomplete
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Armin Ebert</strong> reported that a user
readable file in a known local path could be uploaded to a malicious site. This
was done by manipulating the autocomplete feature in a form and user interaction
with it. While the local file is not visibly uploaded through the form, its
contents are made available through the Document Object Model (DOM) to script
content on the attacking page, leading to information disclosure.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>

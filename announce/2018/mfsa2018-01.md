title: Speculative execution side-channel attack ("Spectre")
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Jann Horn</strong> of Google Project Zero Security reported that
speculative execution performed by modern CPUs could leak information through
a timing side-channel attack. Microsoft Vulnerability Research extended this attack
to browser JavaScript engines and demonstrated that code on a malicious web
page could read data from other web sites (violating the same-origin policy) or
private data from the browser itself.
</p>

<p>Since this new class of attacks involves measuring precise time intervals,
as a partial, short-term, mitigation we are disabling or reducing the precision of
several time sources in Firefox. The precision of <code>performance.now()</code>
has been reduced from 5μs to 20μs, and the <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code>
feature has been disabled because it can be used to construct a high-resolution
timer.</p>

<p class="note"><code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> is already disabled in
Firefox 52 ESR.</p>

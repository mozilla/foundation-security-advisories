  CVE-2018-12359:
    title: Buffer overflow using computed size of canvas element
    impact: critical
    reporter: Nils
    description: |
      A buffer overflow can occur when rendering canvas content while adjusting the height and width of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element dynamically, causing data to be written outside of the currently computed boundaries. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2018-12364:
    title: CSRF attacks through 307 redirects and NPAPI plugins
    impact: high
    reporter: David Black
    description: |
      NPAPI plugins, such as Adobe Flash, can send non-simple cross-origin requests, bypassing CORS by making a same-origin POST that does a 307 redirect to the target site. This allows for a malicious site to engage in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

  CVE-2018-12365:
    title: Compromised IPC child process can list local filenames
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Alex Gaynor
    description: |
      A compromised IPC child process can escape the content sandbox and list the names of arbitrary files on the file system without user consent or interaction. This could result in exposure of private local files.

  CVE-2018-12366:
    title: Invalid data handling during QCMS transformations
    impact: moderate
    reporter: OSS-Fuzz
    description: |
      An invalid grid size during QCMS (color profile) transformations can result in the out-of-bounds read interpreted as a float value. This could leak private data into the output.

  CVE-2018-12368:
    title: No warning when opening executable SettingContent-ms files
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      Windows 10 does not warn users before opening executable files with the <code>SettingContent-ms</code> extension even when they have been downloaded from the internet and have the "Mark of the Web." Without the warning, unsuspecting users unfamiliar with this new file type might run an unwanted executable. This also allows a WebExtension with the limited <code>downloads.open</code> permission to execute arbitrary code without user interaction on Windows 10 systems <br>*Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2018-5188:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 60, Firefox ESR 60.1, and Firefox ESR 52.9
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, David Major, Jon Coppeard, Nicolas B. Pierron, Jason Kratzer, Marcia Knous, and Ronald Crane reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 60, Firefox ESR 60, and Firefox ESR 52.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

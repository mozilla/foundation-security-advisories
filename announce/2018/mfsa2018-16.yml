  CVE-2018-12359:
    title: Buffer overflow using computed size of canvas element
    impact: critical
    reporter: Nils
    description: |
      A buffer overflow can occur when rendering canvas content while adjusting the height and width of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element dynamically, causing data to be written outside of the currently computed boundaries. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2018-12360:
    title: Use-after-free when using focus()
    impact: critical
    reporter: Nils
    description: |
      A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when deleting an <code>input</code> element during a mutation event handler triggered by focusing that element. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2018-12361:
    title: Integer overflow in SwizzleData
    impact: critical
    reporter: R
    description: |
      An integer overflow can occur in the <code>SwizzleData</code> code while calculating buffer sizes. The overflowed value is used for subsequent graphics computations when their inputs are not sanitized which results in a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2018-12362:
    title: Integer overflow in SSSE3 scaler
    impact: high
    reporter: F. Alonso (revskills)
    description: |
      An integer overflow can occur during graphics operations done by the Supplemental Streaming SIMD Extensions 3 (SSSE3) scaler, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2018-5156:
    title: Media recorder segmentation fault when track type is changed during capture
    impact: high
    reporter: Nils
    description: |
      A vulnerability can occur when capturing a media stream when the media source type is changed as the capture is occuring. This can result in stream data being cast to the wrong type causing a potentially exploitable crash.

      - url: 1453127
  CVE-2018-12363:
    title: Use-after-free when appending DOM nodes
    impact: high
    reporter: Nils
    description: |
      A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when script uses mutation events to move DOM nodes between documents, resulting in the old document that held the node being freed but the node still having a pointer referencing it. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2018-12364:
    title: CSRF attacks through 307 redirects and NPAPI plugins
    impact: high
    reporter: David Black
    description: |
      NPAPI plugins, such as Adobe Flash, can send non-simple cross-origin requests, bypassing CORS by making a same-origin POST that does a 307 redirect to the target site. This allows for a malicious site to engage in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

      - url: 1436241 
  CVE-2018-12365:
    title: Compromised IPC child process can list local filenames
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Alex Gaynor
    description: |
      A compromised IPC child process can escape the content sandbox and list the names of arbitrary files on the file system without user consent or interaction. This could result in exposure of private local files. 
    bugs: 
      - url: 1459206
  CVE-2018-12371:
    title: Integer overflow in Skia library during edge builder allocation
    impact: moderate
    reporter: anonymous
    description: |
      An integer overflow vulnerability in the Skia library when allocating memory for edge builders on some systems with at least 16 GB of RAM. This results in the use of uninitialized memory, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

      - url: 1465686
  CVE-2018-12366:
    title: Invalid data handling during QCMS transformations
    impact: moderate
    reporter: OSS-Fuzz
    description: |
      An invalid grid size during QCMS (color profile) transformations can result in the out-of-bounds read interpreted as a float value. This could leak private data into the output.

      - url: 1464039
  CVE-2018-12367:
    title: Timing attack mitigation of PerformanceNavigationTiming
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Andrea Marchesini 
    description: |
      In the previous mitigations for Spectre, the resolution or precision of various methods was reduced to counteract the ability to measure precise time intervals. In that work, <code>PerformanceNavigationTiming</code> was not adjusted but it was found that it could be used as a precision timer.

  CVE-2018-12368:
    title: No warning when opening executable SettingContent-ms files
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      Windows 10 does not warn users before opening executable files with the <code>SettingContent-ms</code> extension even when they have been downloaded from the internet and have the "Mark of the Web." Without the warning, unsuspecting users unfamiliar with this new file type might run an unwanted executable. This also allows a WebExtension with the limited <code>downloads.open</code> permission to execute arbitrary code without user interaction on Windows 10 systems <br>*Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2018-12369:
    title: WebExtension security permission checks bypassed by embedded experiments
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jonathan Kingston
    description: |
      WebExtensions bundled with embedded experiments were not correctly checked for proper authorization. This allowed a malicious WebExtension to gain full browser permissions.

  CVE-2018-5187:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 60 and Firefox ESR 60.1
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Sebastian Hengst, Nils Ohlmeier, Jon Coppeard, Randell Jesup, Ted Campbell, Gary Kwong, and Jean-Yves Avenard reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 60 and Firefox ESR 60. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

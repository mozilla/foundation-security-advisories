  CVE-2018-5158:
    title: Malicious PDF can inject JavaScript into PDF Viewer
    impact: high
    reporter: Wladimir Palant
    description: |
      The PDF viewer does not sufficiently sanitize PostScript calculator functions, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected through a crafted PDF file. This JavaScript can then be run with the permissions of the PDF viewer by its worker.

  CVE-2018-5159:
    title: Integer overflow and out-of-bounds write in Skia
    impact: high
    reporter: Ivan Fratric
    description: |
      An integer overflow can occur in the Skia library due to 32-bit integer use in an array without integer overflow checks, resulting in possible out-of-bounds writes. This could lead to a potentially exploitable crash triggerable by web content.

  CVE-2018-5160:
    title: Uninitialized memory use by WebRTC encoder
    impact: high
    reporter: Andreas Perhson
    description: |
      WebRTC can use a <code>WrappedI420Buffer</code> pixel buffer but the owning image object can be freed while it is still in use. This can result in the WebRTC encoder using uninitialized memory, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2018-5152:
    title: WebExtensions information leak through webRequest API
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Andy McKay
    description: |
      WebExtensions with the appropriate permissions can attach content scripts to Mozilla sites such as accounts.firefox.com and listen to network traffic to the site through the <code>webRequest</code> API. For example, this allows for the interception of username and an encrypted password during login to Firefox Accounts. This issue does not expose synchronization traffic directly and is limited to the process of user login to the website and the data displayed to the user once logged in.

  CVE-2018-5153:
    title: Out-of-bounds read in mixed content websocket messages
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Dennis Fuchs
    description: |
      If websocket data is sent with mixed text and binary in a single message, the binary data can be corrupted. This can result in an out-of-bounds read with the read memory sent to the originating server in response.

  CVE-2018-5163:
    title: Replacing cached data in JavaScript Start-up Bytecode Cache
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Nicolas B. Pierron
    description: |
      If a malicious attacker has used another vulnerability to gain full control over a content process, they may be able to replace the alternate data resources stored in the JavaScript Start-up Bytecode Cache (JSBC) for other JavaScript code. If the parent process then runs this replaced code, the executed script would be run with the parent process' privileges, escaping the sandbox on content processes.
    bugs:
      - url: 1426353
  CVE-2018-5164:
    title: CSP not applied to all multipart content sent with multipart/x-mixed-replace
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Khalil Zhani
    description: |
      Content Security Policy (CSP) is not applied correctly to all parts of multipart content sent with the <code>multipart/x-mixed-replace</code> MIME type. This could allow for script to run where CSP should block it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks. 
    bugs:
      - url: 1416045
  CVE-2018-5166:
    title: WebExtension host permission bypass through filterReponseData
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Francois Lajeunesse Robert
    description: |
      WebExtensions can use request redirection and a <code>filterReponseData</code> filter to bypass host permission settings to redirect network traffic and access content from a host for which they do not have explicit user permission.
    bugs:
      - url: 1437325
  CVE-2018-5167:
    title: "Improper linkification of chrome: and javascript: content in web console and JavaScript debugger"
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Wladimir Palant
    description: |
      The web console and JavaScript debugger do not sanitize all output that can be hyperlinked. Both will display <code>chrome:</code> links as active, clickable hyperlinks in their output. Web sites should not be able to directly link to internal chrome pages. Additionally, the JavaScript debugger will display <code>javascript:</code> links, which users could be tricked into clicking by malicious sites. 
    bugs:
      - url: 1447969
  CVE-2018-5168:
    title: Lightweight themes can be installed without user interaction
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Wladimir Palant
    description: |
      Sites can bypass security checks on permissions to install lightweight themes by manipulating the <code>baseURI</code> property of the theme element. This could allow a malicious site to install a theme without user interaction which could contain offensive or embarrassing images. 
    bugs:
      - url: 1449548
  CVE-2018-5169:
    title: Dragging and dropping link text onto home button can set home page to include chrome pages
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      If manipulated hyperlinked text with <code>chrome:</code> URL contained in it is dragged and dropped on the "home" icon, the home page can be reset to include a normally-unlinkable chrome page as one of the home page tabs. 
    bugs:
      - url: 1319157
  CVE-2018-5172:
    title: Pasted script from clipboard can run in the Live Bookmarks page or PDF viewer
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      The Live Bookmarks page and the PDF viewer can run injected script content if a user pastes script from the clipboard into them while viewing RSS feeds or PDF files. This could allow a malicious site to socially engineer a user to copy and paste malicious script content that could then run with the context of either page but does not allow for privilege escalation.
    bugs:
      - url: 1436482
  CVE-2018-5173:
    title: File name spoofing of Downloads panel with Unicode characters
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      The filename appearing in the <code>Downloads</code> panel improperly renders some Unicode characters, allowing for the file name to be spoofed. This can be used to obscure the file extension of potentially executable files from user view in the panel. <br>*Note: the dialog to open the file will show the full, correct filename and whether it is executable or not.*

  CVE-2018-5174:
    title: Windows Defender SmartScreen UI runs with less secure behavior for downloaded files in Windows 10 April 2018 Update
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jimmy
    description: |
       In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the <code>SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI</code> flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because Windows won’t prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen. <br>*Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other operating systems.*

  CVE-2018-5175:
    title: Universal CSP bypass on sites using strict-dynamic in their policies
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Masato Kinugawa
    description: |
      A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites that have a <code>script-src</code> policy of <code>'strict-dynamic'</code>. If a target website contains an HTML injection flaw an attacker could inject a reference to a copy of the <code>require.js</code> library that is part of Firefox’s Developer Tools, and then use a known technique using that library to bypass the CSP restrictions on executing injected scripts.

  CVE-2018-5176:
    title: JSON Viewer script injection
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Tadj Youssouf
    description: |
      The JSON Viewer displays clickable hyperlinks for strings that are parseable as URLs, including <code>javascript:</code> links. If a JSON file contains malicious JavaScript script embedded as <code>javascript:</code> links, users may be tricked into clicking and running this code in the context of the JSON Viewer. This can allow for the theft of cookies and authorization tokens which are accessible to that context.

  CVE-2018-5177:
    title: Buffer overflow in XSLT during number formatting
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Guyio
    description: |
      A vulnerability exists in XSLT during number formatting where a negative buffer size may be allocated in some instances, leading to a buffer overflow and crash if it occurs.

  CVE-2018-5165:
    title: Checkbox for enabling Flash protected mode is inverted in 32-bit Firefox
    impact: low
    reporter: David Parks
    description: |
      In 32-bit versions of Firefox, the Adobe Flash plugin setting for "Enable Adobe Flash protected mode" is unchecked by default even though the Adobe Flash sandbox is actually enabled. The displayed state is the reverse of the true setting, resulting in user confusion. This could cause users to select this setting intending to activate it and inadvertently turn protections off.

      - url: 1451452
  CVE-2018-5180:
    title: heap-use-after-free in mozilla::WebGLContext::DrawElementsInstanced
    impact: low
    reporter: Nils
    description: |
      A use-after-free vulnerability can occur during WebGL operations. While this results in a potentially exploitable crash, the vulnerability is limited because the memory is freed and reused in a brief window of time during the freeing of the same callstack.

  CVE-2018-5181:
    title: Local file can be displayed in noopener tab through drag and drop of hyperlink
    impact: low
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      If a URL using the <code>file:</code> protocol is dragged and dropped onto an open tab that is running in a different child process the tab will open a local file corresponding to the dropped URL, contrary to policy. One way to make the target tab open more reliably in a separate process is to open it with the <code>noopener</code> keyword. 
    bugs:
      - url: 1424107
  CVE-2018-5182:
    title: Local file can be displayed from hyperlink dragged and dropped on addressbar
    impact: low
    reporter: Jordi Chancel
    description: |
      If a text string that happens to be a filename in the operating system's native format is dragged and dropped onto the addressbar the specified local file will be opened. This is contrary to policy and is what would happen if the string were the equivalent <code>file:</code> URL.
    bugs:
      - url: 1435908
  CVE-2018-5179:
    title: Service workers can self update to keep a worker running
    impact: low
    reporter: Yannic Bonenberger
    description: |
      A service worker can send the "activate" event on itself periodically which allows it to run perpetually. This would allow any malicious activity, such as logging an IP address by the service worker, to occur in the background.

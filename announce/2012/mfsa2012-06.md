title: Uninitialized memory appended when encoding icon images may cause information
  disclosure
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Tim Abraldes</strong> reported that when encoding
images as <code>image/vnd.microsoft.icon</code> the resulting data was always a
fixed size, with uninitialized memory appended as padding beyond the size of the
actual image. This is the result of mImageBufferSize in the encoder being
initialized with a value different than the size of the source image. There is
the possibility of sensitive data from uninitialized memory being appended to a
PNG image when converted fron an ICO format image. This sensitive data may then
be disclosed in the resulting image.
</p>
<p class="note">Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability.

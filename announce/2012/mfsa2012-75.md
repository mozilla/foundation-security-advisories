title: select element persistance allows for attacks
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>David Bloom</strong> of Cue discovered that
<code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements are always-on-top chromeless windows and
that navigation away from a page with an active <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> menu
does not remove this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on a
new page, the original <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an attacker to cover
arbitrary portions of the new page through absolute positioning/scrolling,
leading to spoofing attacks. Security researcher <strong>Jordi Chancel</strong>
found a variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was well.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>

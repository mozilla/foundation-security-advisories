title: XSS with XPCNativeWrapper(window).Function(...)
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>shutdown reports that cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks could be
performed using the construct XPCNativeWrapper(window).Function(...),
which created a function that appeared to belong to the window in
question even after it had been navigated to the target site.</p>

<p>This vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development, it does
not affect Firefox 1.0 or Mozilla Suite 1.7</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
JavaScript in mail.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until you can upgrade to a fixed version. Do not enable
JavaScript in mail clients such as Thunderbird.</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>Exploit details withheld until after the upgrade period.</p>

title: Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:9.0)
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.</p>

<p>In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird
and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk
in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>

<p>These vulnerabilities did not affect the older browser engine used
prior to Firefox 4.</p>

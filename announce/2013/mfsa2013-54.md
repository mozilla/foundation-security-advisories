title: Data in the body of XHR HEAD requests leads to CSRF attacks
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Johnathan Kuskos</strong> reported that Firefox
is sending data in the body of  XMLHttpRequest (XHR) HEAD requests, which goes
against the XHR specification. This can potentially be used for Cross-Site
Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks against sites which do not distinguish
between HEAD and POST requests.</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>

title: Privileged access for content level constructor
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Cody Crews</strong> reported a method to call a
content level constructor that allows for this constructor to have chrome
privileged accesss. This affects chrome object wrappers (COW) and allows for
write actions on objects when only read actions should be allowed. This can lead
to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
